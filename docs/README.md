### Notes

The original MyTunes Music Player was offered in a "Lite" version (with limited features), and a "Pro" version that was ad supported. With version 3.0, the "Lite" version has been discontinued and I have decided to simply offer the "Pro" version free of charge. If you enjoy the app, please leave a review on the Google Play Store.
